## procedure

### **Questions:**

1. Are the metadata of both files equal or different?

R. Yes, they are different.

2. If so, what file-tags are different?

R. Almost all the metadata changed, the applications made a compress to the picture, and the dates are different. the File section have some data different, the JFIF is also different, the EXIF drastically changed, the phone information is gone and we only have the information of the resolution and the image. In the original picture there is a MakerNotes section and MPF that are not anymore. On the Kakaotalk application, there is a new section of metadata called Photoshop, but the ICC_Profile section is still there same as original. The Composite section exist in all versions, but the other ones (not the original) only contain image size and megapixels, the original have so much more, even the GPS location.

3. Can the metadata of a file be manipulated?

R. It can be easily modified, but usually there is evidence of the modification. To modify metadata and hide it, is also possible but not easy.

4. Are the metadata of a file useful as an evidence for a CF case?

R. Metadata can provide crucial information about the origin, history, and manipulation of digital files, so it is useful for a CF case. The information is important for establishing timelines, identifying suspects, corroborating testimonies, and reconstructing digital activities.
